# Gomoku
A little Gomoku game!

This game is written in Python with module Pygame. On the UI disign I received help from the tutorial on this website: https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/python-game-project-tic-tac-toe/

The AI I am using now is solely running on rules that I write. It does not do any learning at the moment, and can be stupid in some occasions. I plan on writing a new AI that can do reinforcement learning with the help of maybe neural networks later this year.

The UI/UX is also primitive now: I will add features later!
